:VDiff[!] <filename>       : Open a vertial difference between the current file that restores buffer settings
:HDiff[!] <filename>       : Open a horizontal difference between the current file that restores buffer settings
                                                                                                                
In both cases the ! causes the specified buffer not to be unloaded when a
window is closed, or another window is opened.  In this case, the settings
will be restored using the original settings of the first buffer.
